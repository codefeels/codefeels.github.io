Oftentimes\ntook me pretty deep debugging to even figure out that one weird enhancement had\nsuch a weird knock on effect to create bug X and so with the silence from my\nteam, i feel unappreciated in addition to all this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is, perhaps, not really unique to my particular scenario. The feelings\nthat I get from this, anxiety and feeling unappreciated, can happen in many\nother scenarios, exacerbated by remote work, pandemic, team culture, etc. I\nhope to work to make things better somehow though\u003c/p\u003e"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/archive","query":{},"buildId":"1qEGg0fJgYZXO_OZsoKH0","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>

<p>So, I oftentimes will make a PR to this effect and say, "here is a fix, it
basically removes the enhancement, and fixes a bug. This is a bug users
definitely will definitely run into, so we should probably merge this and
release it so that they don't run into it". what I normally get in response to
this is crickets</p>
<p>I can guess at some reasons why my coworkers are avoiding this issue maybe. For
example</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they don't want to "duplicate work" by undoing the enhancement on the master
branch (and later redoing it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they have pride in their feature and don't want to see it undone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they are trying to be sensitive to the feelings of the person who originally
developed the enhancement, and avoid undoing it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they are not "satisfied" with the PR that removes the enhancement, and would
rather see a fix to the enhancement</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reality though is there is often very little feedback on these PRs that I
make, so I just have to sit around with anxiety. There are currently at least 3
of these on my codebase from enhancements I did not make, but which I created
fixes for that basically rollback portions of these enhancements. Oftentimes
took me pretty deep debugging to even figure out that one weird enhancement had
such a weird knock on effect to create bug X and so with the silence from my
team, i feel unappreciated in addition to all this.</p>
<p>This is, perhaps, not really unique to my particular scenario. The feelings
that I get from this, anxiety and feeling unappreciated, can happen in many
other scenarios, exacerbated by remote work, pandemic, team culture, etc. I
hope to work to make things better somehow though</p></div></article></div></main></div><footer style="margin-top:100px"><a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/archive">Archive</a> <a href="https://github.com/codefeels/">Github</a> </footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Waiting for feedback","date":"2020-12-07","slug":"2021-12-07-waiting","html":"\u003cp\u003eSometimes, basically removing the enhancement, or disabling it, will fix it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I oftentimes will make a PR to this effect and say, \"here is a fix, it\nbasically removes the enhancement, and fixes a bug.

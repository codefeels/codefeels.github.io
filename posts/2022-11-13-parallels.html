<p>I feel like my boss rarely has a clue for what is right for our project. I feel
he is very aloof. And I feel like his engagement with important situations is
often fairly shallow. I feel very stressed out and frayed very constantly,
while I think my boss feels very little of this, and he often gives overly
optimistic outlooks.</p>

<p>I often have not very much engagement on domestic issues such as for example,
travel, lodging, etc. I just think everything is fine, and whatever ends up
happening is ok. And yet, my girlfriend is often running very high stress about
these issues. She claims that I don't listen to her, and is often extremely
annoyed by the input that I do have.</p>

<p>I do not know. In my job, I need to chill the fuck out or find a better
solution than butting heads all the time. Same thing in my personal life, yet
in that case, I feel like I am not the fight-seeker.</p></div></article></div></main></div><footer style="margin-top:100px"><a href="/">Home</a> <a href="/archive">Archive</a> <a href="https://github.com/codefeels/">Github</a> </footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"A sad parallel in work relationships and personal relationships","date":"2022-11-13","slug":"2022-11-13-parallels","html":"\u003ch2 id=\"in-my-job-i-often-butt-heads-with-my-boss\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#in-my-job-i-often-butt-heads-with-my-boss\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#in-my-job-i-often-butt-heads-with-my-boss\" style=\"margin-right: 10px\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIn my job, I often butt heads with my boss.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like my boss rarely has a clue for what is right for our project.

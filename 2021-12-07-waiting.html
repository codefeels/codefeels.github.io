basically removes the enhancement, and fixes a bug. This is a bug users
definitely will definitely run into, so we should probably merge this and
release it so that they don&#x27;t run into it&quot;. what I normally get in response to
this is crickets</p><p>I can guess at some reasons why my coworkers are avoiding this issue maybe. For
example</p><ul><li><p>they don&#x27;t want to &quot;duplicate work&quot; by undoing the enhancement on the master
branch (and later redoing it)</p></li><li><p>they have pride in their feature and don&#x27;t want to see it undone</p></li><li><p>they are trying to be sensitive to the feelings of the person who originally
developed the enhancement, and avoid undoing it</p></li><li><p>they are not &quot;satisfied&quot; with the PR that removes the enhancement, and would
rather see a fix to the enhancement</p></li></ul><p>The reality though is there is often very little feedback on these PRs that I
make, so I just have to sit around with anxiety. There are currently at least 3
of these on my codebase from enhancements I did not make, but which I created
fixes for that basically rollback portions of these enhancements. Oftentimes
took me pretty deep debugging to even figure out that one weird enhancement had
such a weird knock on effect to create bug X and so with the silence from my
team, i feel unappreciated in addition to all this.</p><p>This is, perhaps, not really unique to my particular scenario. The feelings
that I get from this, anxiety and feeling unappreciated, can happen in many
other scenarios, exacerbated by remote work, pandemic, team culture, etc. I
hope to work to make things better somehow though</p></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/2021-12-07-waiting","query":{},"buildId":"PIJawAtfrB9HG5isoNOni","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>

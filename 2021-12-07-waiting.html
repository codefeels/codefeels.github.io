and therefore there are bugs on the main branch</p><p>Sometimes, basically removing the enhancement, or disabling it, will fix it</p><p>So, I oftentimes will make a PR to this effect and say, &quot;here is a fix, it
basically removes the enhancement, and fixes a bug. This is a bug users
definitely will definitely run into, so we should probably merge this and
release it so that they don&#x27;t run into it&quot;. what I normally get in response to
this is crickets</p><p>I can guess at some reasons why my coworkers are avoiding this issue maybe. For
example</p><ul><li><p>they don&#x27;t want to &quot;duplicate work&quot; by undoing the enhancement on the master
branch (and later redoing it)</p></li><li><p>they have pride in their feature and don&#x27;t want to see it undone</p></li><li><p>they are trying to be sensitive to the feelings of the person who originally
developed the enhancement, and avoid undoing it</p></li><li><p>they are not &quot;satisfied&quot; with the PR that removes the enhancement, and would
rather see a fix to the enhancement</p></li><li><p>they are busy and don&#x27;t have time to respond to requests to review, pings in
chat messages, and tagged in pr comments</p></li></ul><p>So, generally, there is very little feedback on these PRs, so I just have to
sit around and feel anxious, and like a brat expecting people to care about
this thing. Oftentimes it took me a fair amount of debugging to even make such
a PR, since it is sometimes pretty unexpected why enhancement X would break
some core thing Y so the silence makes me feel unappreciated in addition to all
this.</p><p>Note that my team has generally not been great about code reviews so this is
just an aspect to this, I fairly frequently merge my own PRs if they are small
but in a case where it rolls back someone&#x27;s work, I definitely feel like
including them in the review process.</p><p>Overall, this is not really just about waiting for feedback. It&#x27;s about remote
work. It&#x27;s about teamwork and communication and code review culture. It&#x27;s also
a pandemic, everyones busy, dropping balls, etc. If I find ways to improve,
will update this post.</p></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/2021-12-07-waiting","query":{},"buildId":"Apy_QCVo3KlvFufq6B1uF","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>

title: A sad parallel in work relationships and personal relationships

## In my job, I often butt heads with my boss.

I feel like my boss rarely has a clue for what is right for our project. I feel
he is very aloof. And I feel like his engagement with important situations is
often fairly shallow. I feel very stressed out and frayed very constantly,
while I think my boss feels very little of this, and he often gives overly
optimistic outlooks.

## With my partner at home, there is a disturbing parallel

I often have not very much engagement on domestic issues such as for example,
travel, lodging, etc. I just think everything is fine, and whatever ends up
happening is ok. And yet, my girlfriend is often running very high stress about
these issues. She claims that I don't listen to her, and is often extremely
annoyed by the input that I do have.

## What's the conclusion or resolution to these issues?

I do not know. In my job, I need to chill the fuck out or find a better
solution than butting heads all the time. Same thing in my personal life, yet
in that case, I feel like I am not the fight-seeker.

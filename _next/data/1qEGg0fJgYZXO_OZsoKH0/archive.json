This is a bug users\ndefinitely will definitely run into, so we should probably merge this and\nrelease it so that they don't run into it\". what I normally get in response to\nthis is crickets</p>\n<p>I can guess at some reasons why my coworkers are avoiding this issue maybe. For\nexample</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>they don't want to \"duplicate work\" by undoing the enhancement on the master\nbranch (and later redoing it)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>they have pride in their feature and don't want to see it undone</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>they are trying to be sensitive to the feelings of the person who originally\ndeveloped the enhancement, and avoid undoing it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>they are not \"satisfied\" with the PR that removes the enhancement, and would\nrather see a fix to the enhancement</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reality though is there is often very little feedback on these PRs that I\nmake, so I just have to sit around with anxiety. There are currently at least 3\nof these on my codebase from enhancements I did not make, but which I created\nfixes for that basically rollback portions of these enhancements. Oftentimes\ntook me pretty deep debugging to even figure out that one weird enhancement had\nsuch a weird knock on effect to create bug X and so with the silence from my\nteam, i feel unappreciated in addition to all this.</p>\n<p>This is, perhaps, not really unique to my particular scenario. The feelings\nthat I get from this, anxiety and feeling unappreciated, can happen in many\nother scenarios, exacerbated by remote work, pandemic, team culture, etc. I\nhope to work to make things better somehow though</p>"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
